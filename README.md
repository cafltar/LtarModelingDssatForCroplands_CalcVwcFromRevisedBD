## Purpose

Calculate volumetric water content using legacy gravimetric water content measurements and revised/QC'd/Production-level bulk density values.

The gravimetric data was originally used to calculate volumetric through "representitive" bulk density values taken at locations with similar soil types instead of the same location that gravimetric was measured. This effort is to use more representitive bulk density data.
